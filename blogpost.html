                <p>Doyou ever sit down at 6 p.m. and think that you’ve had an incredibly busy day but didn’t really accomplish much?
    If you ever feel like your days are just passing by, it’s likely because you’re spending the majority of your time on the wrong things.
    And the most dangerous time of the day to waste is your morning.
    As Richard Whately once said:
    “Lose an hour in the morning, and you will spend all day looking for it.”
    If you spend your morning doing the wrong things, you’ll likely lack energy, motivation, and willpower to do the right things throughout the rest of your day.
    By eliminating the following habits, however, you’ll make space for the important decisions, tasks, and people in your life.
    Planning Your Day</p>


    <p >
    If you fail to plan, you’ll also fail to execute. But if you spend the first minutes of your day planning your schedule, you’ll waste enormous amounts of precious energy on that repetitive task.
    “Write a to-do list to stay organized” is common productivity advice, but what most people overlook is that you’re too late if you set up your to-do list in the morning.
    Yes, being organized is the key to a fulfilled life, but you shouldn’t get organized first thing in the morning.
    Your plans should be ready when you get up.
    Otherwise, you’ll spend mental energy on prioritizing your tasks and lack that mental power when it comes to doing all these things.
    Waking up to a concrete plan for the day will help you be clearer about what you want to achieve and how to get it, but it will also allow you to focus more easily.
    What to do instead:
    If you want to make the most out of each day, set your priorities before going to bed.
    When you wake up, your daily schedule and plan should be ready and waiting for you to tick off your to-dos.
    Don’t allow yourself to feel overwhelmed in the early hours of your day. Instead, be well-prepared and set your priorities in the evening.
    There’s no better feeling than going to bed knowing that you’re well prepared to tackle the next day.
    And when planning your daily schedule and tasks, make sure to keep it to a minimum: Your schedule shouldn’t contain more than a few important tasks per day.
    I organize my daily schedule with a simple tool called Todoist and make sure to have no more than 3–5 prioritized tasks per day.</p>


    <p>
    Whenever I tried to get more big tasks done in a day, I ended up feeling overwhelmed and overstressed. This number obviously depends on the tasks you want to get done and can vary depending on your projects but on average, a maximum of 3–5 priorities is a good start.
    Complaining
    Quite often, we don’t even realize that negative conversations and thoughts can influence us for hours.
    For most people, it even feels natural to complain about the weather, politics, or their job as part of their morning routine.
    But if you start your day by complaining about your job, partner, family, or whatsoever, you’ll take that negative mood with you for at least a few hours, sometimes even for the entire day.
    By complaining, you focus on obstacles and problems, which makes it harder to recognize opportunities. It’s nothing more than a surefire way to start your day on the wrong foot.
    What to do instead:
    Your words and thoughts don’t only affect your motivation but your entire state of mind.
    If you start your day by complaining, you’ll find more and more things to complain about throughout the day. Not because there is so much to complain about, but because you focus on it.
    If you, however, focus on the bright side of life, you’ll come across even more things that will cheer you up and boost your happiness.</p>


    <p>
    That’s why you need to train your mind to focus on the good first thing in the morning.
    Instead of looking for things to complain about, focus on the things you’re grateful for.
    I’ve been keeping a gratitude journal for years and it’s by far the most effective tool I ever used to raise my energy and shift from tired, unmotivated, and lazy to being grateful and happy every single morning.
    All you need to do is preparing a small notebook and writing down what you’re grateful for as part of your morning routine.
    I usually come up with at least 15–20 items on that list, but you can start with three items and work your way up.
    At first, a gratitude journal might feel uncommon, but you’ll get used to it quickly and reap the benefits within just a few days.
    If you struggle to come up with items for your list, start with the more obvious but often overlooked things such as:
    I’m grateful for being healthy.
    I’m grateful for my home.
    I’m grateful for my family.
    I’m grateful for having enough to eat and drink.
    I’m grateful for having access to education.
    I’m grateful for living in a safe country.
    Getting Straight to Work
    Mornings are the perfect time to take care of your health and to get inspired.
    Most people find it hard to incorporate positive habits into their busy schedules if they don’t do it first thing in the morning.
    But the majority get up just early enough so they make it to work on time because they’re too lazy to get up earlier.
    However, the truth is that most of the time, sleeping for a few more minutes will only leave you even lazier, make you slow, and cut your productivity.
    What to do instead:
    Instead of getting up and rushing to work, take some time to do things that will benefit your physical and mental health.
    It’s easier to take time and care about yourself in the morning before you face distractions.
    Stop relying on caffeine to feel more awake. Instead, get up 30 minutes earlier and do something good for your body, soul, and mind.
